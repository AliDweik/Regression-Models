# Regression Analysis on Boston Housing Dataset 🏘️📈

This project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course at university. It explores and compares different regression techniques using the **Boston Housing Dataset** to predict housing prices based on various features.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the following regression models:

- ✅ Simple Linear Regression
- ✅ Multiple Linear Regression
- ✅ Polynomial Regression

Each model is trained, tested, and evaluated using relevant performance metrics and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **Boston Housing Dataset** (from scikit-learn or UCI repository)
- Features include crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, etc.
- Target: Median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`)


## 🧪 Model Evaluation Metrics

- R-squared (R²)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visual inspection of model fit (plots)

## 📈 Key Results

- **Simple Linear Regression** was easy to implement but underperformed.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** significantly improved predictions by incorporating more features.
- **Polynomial Regression** provided better fits for certain variables but risked overfitting at higher degrees.

## 🧠 Conclusion

- Multiple Linear Regression gave the most balanced performance.
- Polynomial Regression can help when relationships are nonlinear but needs tuning.
- This project helped build foundational understanding of regression modeling and evaluation.
